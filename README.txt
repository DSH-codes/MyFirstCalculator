
Hello there!

I hope this finds you in excellent health and spirits. 

I'm thrilled to introduce my first desktop app for Windows, 

created during the winter of 2022 when I embarked on my coding journey through Sololearn.

As a beginner, I acknowledge that my first coding experience may not be perfect. 

The code is messy and disorganized, but that's all part of the learning process. 

I'm confident that we've all been there at some point, so please be gentle with your feedback.

The demo video provides a comprehensive overview of how to use the app, which I've dubbed Quick Calculator.
 
While it may not be a sophisticated piece of software, I'm confident that you'll find it user-friendly.

If you decide to modify the code and create an executable file using auto-py-to-exe, 
please ensure that you include the (tix8.4.3) folder in the additional files section. 
This is crucial, as it enables the balloon message to function correctly 
when you hover your mouse over buttons in the settings section of the Calculator.

I wish you all the best on your own coding adventures!
